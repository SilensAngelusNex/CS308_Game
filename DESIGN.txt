Name:
Goal:           Defeat all enemies (campaign mode)
                Capture enemy starting point (multiplayer)
Mechanics:      Use arrow keys to navigate menus
                Use Q, W, E, R
                    Q:  Examine highlighted element
                    W:  Bring up menu

                    R:  Select option
                Attack enemy units with your units to destroy them.
                See GamePrelim for a more in depth explanation of mechanics and
                    a whole bunch of features I won't have time to implement.
Levels/Modes:   Campaign
                    Play against (simple) AI and level up your units
                    Primary win condition is to defeat all enemy units
                        (More to come if I have lots of time.)
                Multiplayer
                    Play against a human opponent
                    Primary win condition is to capture the enemy starting space
                        (Maybe defeat a leader unit or something similar. Again,
                        More to come if I have lots of time.)
